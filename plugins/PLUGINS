To make a plugin, define a function and import it to the twatbot.py
Add it to the list of functions, it should take in a reference to an
object containing a dic dataN containing information about the last
message received from the server. This object also has methods for
sending messages and joining channelsd:
    dic = {
        'fool':fool,  #User who sent message
        'msg':msg,    #The text part of the message
        'cmd':cmd,    #The command they used: privmsg, quit etc.
        'chan':chan,  #The channel the message was sent from, useful
                      #for replying
        'raw':data,   #The raw server message
        'words':words #The message split into words
        }
Add some docs in here about available variables and functions

Have a list of all plugins in parser.py
Have a dict of triggers defined in each plugin that map to the plugins
main function, eg: {'^play':play}
